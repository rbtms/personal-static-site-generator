This is the later post in a 2-part series about tripcodes. If you haven't read part 1, it's [here](/blog/tripcodes_1.html).

## DES overview

## Implementing DES

## Benchmark methodology

## First optimizations

### Precomputing everything
### Inlining as much as possible

## Bitslice optimizations

## Running it on the browser

## CPU intrinsics

## Testing correctness

## Where's the speed difference?
